I just want to cuddle with you like this forever.

I would be reminiscing about the life we have and had together. Remembering all the details and things we went through, the time we had together, the memories, just unforgettable. I would give my everything to relive the life of us again if I had a chance. My wonderful girl, I'm so much happy for the time we have now. I love you so much, I love you. Under the setting sun on this quite beach, there'll be just us, alone but not lonely. I'll hold you tight, my dearest.

                            The sun sets and the night comes. We're on the beach, under the countless stars, the Milky Way is looking us down form the above. We were always under the same sky, under the same stars, but we used to be thousands of miles away. And now that we're together, is it a dream? The calmness of the night, soothing sound of the sea waves, I can hear you breathing slowly. A gentle breeze blew through us. Just thinking, what else matters when I have you with me. What else matters. I sometimes wish, we can pause the time just right here, and be together forever. I don't care how long it takes, I'll come close to you. It will be okay nw. I promise you here, just like this view now, we'll also go watch Halley's Comet too. Let's be together for many more years. I Love You.
